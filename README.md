# Market Models Mini Project 1

## Overview
This repository has been established for the Market Models Mini Project 1 as part of the STAT 686 course during the Spring 2024 semester at Rice University.

## Strategies
Contained within are three time-series strategy Jupyter notebooks, each one dedicated to a distinct financial analysis strategy:
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The Apple stock dataset is utilized across all strategies to demonstrate the application of the models.

## Usage
To apply these strategies to other companies:
1. Replace the `in_path` filename with your desired stock dataset.
2. Run the code in the corresponding notebook to generate the analysis results.

## Datasets
Included in this repository are the five datasets that were used throughout the project. Their use is detailed within the individual notebooks, guiding you on how to leverage them for your analysis.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this project and customize the strategies to fit your datasets or contribute improvements to the existing methods.
